Problem Statement :

Drone technology has become more prominent than ever in commercial and defense
applications. One of the main challenges of this technology is the navigation and control of
these drones autonomously in various terrains. Design a model/prototype/system for controlling
the droneâ€™s flight path via ground markers. You are free to choose the specifications of the
ground markers while keeping in mind their practicality.
